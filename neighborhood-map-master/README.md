# Neighborhood Map Project
####By Amelia Krafft

This is a Udacity project which was about creating a neigborhood map. I created my neighborhood map on Dublin and 5 good restaurants that exist there. If you click ```index.html``` file, you can view my neighborhood map.

To view my project you can either download it as a zip file or click on this live link:

### Final Comment
I shared my work with my sister Clara Krafft who is also right now working on this course. This is why we could have some similarities in our code.
